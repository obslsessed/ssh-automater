some ssh thing
## usage
### this is copied directly from the --help
```
a (bad) thing to go through (local) ip addresses and (try to) ssh into them. basically, imagine if you could run "ssh 192.168.1.*"

Usage: ssh-automater [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -p, --port <PORT>  port [default: 22]
  -u, --user <USER>  user
  -0, --zero         192.168.0.* instead of 192.168.1.* // i don't know what the difference is
  -h, --help         Print help information
  -V, --version      Print version information
  ```
